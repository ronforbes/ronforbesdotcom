## ⬆️ Finding Your True North in a World of Endless Possibilities

Have you ever been asked where you see yourself in five years and felt your stomach drop? That dreaded interview question that seems designed to expose the fact that most of us are just figuring things out as we go along?

Last night, I received a call from one of my closest friends. He was preparing for a job interview and needed help answering that exact question:

*"What's your five-year vision, and what steps are you taking toward it?"*

Instead of helping him craft a polished but hollow answer, I asked him to tell me about his most fulfilling career roles and what he loved about them. That's when something magical happened.

## 💬 When Interviews Become Conversations

As soon as we shifted from "what will impress the interviewer" to "what truly matters to you," everything changed. The rehearsed answers disappeared, replaced by genuine passion and excitement. He spoke animatedly about projects that had lit him up from the inside, connections he'd formed, and problems he'd solved that gave him a sense of purpose.

When he would slip back into interview mode—carefully choosing words and planning his delivery—I'd gently interrupt.

*"Stop thinking," I'd say. "Just feel what's coming up."*

A short time later, he had crafted a vision and action plan that felt authentic, directed, and genuinely exciting to hear. I'd hire that guy in a heartbeat (though I admit I'm biased—he's one of my closest friends).

## 🤯 The Transformative Power of WHY

This experience reinforced something I've observed repeatedly in both personal and professional contexts: when we start with **WHY**, everything else falls into place.

Simon Sinek famously said,

*"People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it."*

This principle extends far beyond business and marketing—it's fundamental to how we connect as human beings.

When my friend spoke from his **WHY**, he wasn't just answering a question; he was inviting the interviewer into his story, his purpose, his vision for making an impact.

## 🤔 Channeling Your Inner Wisdom

Starting with **WHY** isn't just a strategic communication technique—it's an invitation to connect with your deeper self. When we pause to ask ourselves why something matters to us, we channel what I call our **"inner divinity"**—that intuitive wisdom that sees connections and possibilities beyond our immediate logical thinking.

This inner compass knows your direction even when your conscious mind is cluttered with doubts, expectations, and "shoulds."

## 🧘🏾‍♂️ How to Find Your WHY

The next time you face a daunting question or an ambiguous situation:

1. **Create space for silence**. Take a moment away from the noise of opinions and expectations.
2. **Close your eyes and go inward**. Your intuition often speaks in whispers, not shouts.
3. **Ask yourself**: What about this lights me up? What values am I honoring? Who am I serving?
4. **Feel, don't just think**. Notice the physical sensations that arise when you consider different paths.
5. **Listen for resonance**. The right direction often feels like a **"yes"** in your body before your mind can articulate why.

## 🧭 Beyond Interviews: WHY as a Life Compass

This approach extends far beyond job interviews. Whether you're:

- Considering a career change
- Making a major life decision
- Starting a new project
- Building a new relationship
- Setting goals for the future

Beginning with **WHY** grounds you in purpose rather than just activity.

## 💌 The Invitation

So I invite you to practice this simple but profound shift: Before you plan what to do or how to do it, take a moment to be silent, close your eyes, go inside, and listen to your inner intuition that already knows.

Ask yourself:

*"Why does this matter to me?"*

And watch as clarity, direction, and authentic passion naturally follow.

*What area of your life might benefit from revisiting your **WHY**? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.*
