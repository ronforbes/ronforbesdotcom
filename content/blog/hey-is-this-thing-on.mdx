## Welcome to my latest experiment in turning degeneracy into productivity 🥳

If we haven't met before, I'm Ron. I'm a 39-year-old product manager working on a virtual reality device called [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/quest/) and part-time creator.

Whenever I move to a new city, I start a group text called **The Degenerates** among my close friends 📱 It's a place to coordinate meetups, exchange jams of the day, share sick memes, and otherwise build community in what can otherwise feel like a lonely world in our mid-to-late thirties.

From an outsider's perspective, these threads might seem pretty childish, but it turns out that we're also high-functioning adults: we've built thriving careers; some have completed incredible acts of physical grit; we've journeyed to every corner of the world; and at the end of the day, we all just love going out dancing to ignorant rap music (ok, maybe that's just me 😅).

Over the years, my contributions to the Degenerates have often been in the areas of career coaching, managing personal finances, and tech consulting. I end up repeating a lot of advice to my friends navigating what life throws at them.

So I thought…

> 💬 **"Why not put it in a newsletter?"**

And here we are! 🚀

In this free weekly(ish) newsletter, I'll share actionable tips on productivity, practical career advice, health pointers from a recovering party animal, the best insights I've come across on the web (and maybe a little degenerative banter 🤪).

## Quick Housekeeping ✅

I hate most email, but I also hate missing the email I actually wanted to read. So if you want to avoid suffering:

**If you use Gmail,** move The Degenerate to your Primary inbox.

**If you use Apple Mail,** add this email address to your VIPs.

## Wrapping Up

With that out of the way, thanks for subscribing. I'll do my best to make this newsletter as valuable as it can be, or at least hopefully a source of a laugh throughout the week.

Seeya you degenerate,

-Ron
