## Expanding Horizons in VisionOS and VR Development

In this entry, I want to delve deeper into the goals behind my game development project. As I embark on this journey to create a modern successor to Tetris Attack for visionOS, my objectives are twofold: personal growth in virtual/mixed reality app development and creating an engaging game that resonates with both current and future generations of gamers.

## Learning and Growing at Meta

I'm Ron, currently working as a product manager at Meta, focusing on the Quest virtual (and more recently mixed) reality system. This project is more than just a passion for gaming; it's a pathway to deepen my understanding and skills in XR development on visionOS and Quest. The insights and expertise I gain here will directly contribute to my effectiveness in my role at Meta. By navigating the intricacies of visionOS, I hope to bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to our work on the Quest platform, ultimately enhancing user experiences in the XR space.

## Crafting an Engaging Experience for Gamers

My second goal is to develop a game that not only appeals to avid fans of competitive puzzle games but also attracts a new generation of players. Tetris Attack was one of my favorite games as kid, and I vividly remember the "Tetris Effect" of going to sleep and dreaming of falling blocks, inspired by my love of the game. I envision a modern successor that's easy to pick up but challenging to master, with layers of strategy and dynamic gameplay that keep players coming back for more. The integration of VR and mixed reality elements offers an exciting opportunity to innovate within the genre, creating a truly immersive and interactive experience.

## Building With Purpose

In the coming weeks, I'll be setting specific objectives around these goals. Learning and building an entertaining product are excellent starting points, but I aim to define clear milestones and strategies to ensure that every step taken is purposeful and impactful. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, experimenting with unique game mechanics, or engaging with the gaming community for feedback, every aspect of this project is geared towards growth and innovation.

## Join Me on This Exciting Journey

I invite you to be a part of this journey. Your support, feedback, and ideas are invaluable as I navigate the challenges and triumphs of developing this game. Together, let's push the boundaries of VR gaming and create something truly special!
