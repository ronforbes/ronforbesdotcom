I'm writing this on the train back from D.C. after visiting my brother, his wife, and my nephew and niece for a hot pot night with their friends. It turned into an early birthday celebration for my brother — his actual birthday's next Friday — and we surprised him with a **PlayStation 5** so he can finally play *Final Fantasy VII Remake*, *Rebirth*, and *Final Fantasy XVI* (plus whatever else he can squeeze in between diaper changes). Watching him play *Stardew Valley* with his son whose hands are too small to hold the controller was a surreal moment of intergenerational love.

Parenting is a full-time job for Carlton and Alice, but it's beautiful to see how they've built a warm, joyful home together. Watching them raise Kai and Vera as a team is inspiring — not because it looks effortless, but because they make the effort every single day. It's a reminder that love isn't just a feeling; it's the daily act of building something lasting together. As I head back home to New York, I'm feeling grateful, grounded, and inspired to keep doing the same.

## 🗽 Moving to NYC

A *lot* has happened since my last post in February — the biggest one being: **I moved to New York City.**

It's been a few months now, and it's starting to feel more and more like home. This move began as an experiment — I wanted to figure out where I wanted to live next. LA? NYC? Stay in Seattle? Somewhere totally new?

In the end, I chose New York for two reasons:

1. I wanted to **prioritize family** in this next chapter of life.
2. I was ready for **something new and uncomfortable** — the kind of discomfort that forces growth.

It wasn't easy leaving the West Coast. I have such a deep network of friends there — especially Jai and Jay in LA, and Andrew in San Diego. But they've been nothing but supportive, reminding me that distance doesn't change the bond.

## 💼 Reigniting My Work

Thankfully, I was able to **keep my same role at Meta**, and if anything, the move has *re-energized* me.

Being on East Coast time means I start my day at 10 a.m., which gives me a couple of quiet hours before the West Coast wakes up. Those mornings have become my time to think deeply, plan, and create.

The challenge, of course, is drawing boundaries — making sure my 7 p.m. cutoff actually means 7 p.m. But I'm lucky to have a manager and team who genuinely support that balance.

## 🏡 The Move (a.k.a. Chaos Mode)

Then there's the reality of picking up your entire life and moving across the country.

I'm still in the process of selling my home in Seattle — not exactly the easiest time to be a homeowner with interest rates this high. I told myself to treat this as an investment in the next chapter, even if it costs a bit more than expected.

And let's just say: **moving did not go smoothly.** The movers broke a bunch of things, the apartment was a mess for weeks, and downsizing from a townhouse to a one-bedroom meant purging half my life.

But piece by piece, it came together. The chaos turned into comfort. The apartment started to feel like home. I joke with friends that if they visit, they'll have to sleep in the bathroom — but it's cozy, creative, and mine.

## 🤖 Riding the AI Wave

The world's changed a lot too. AI has exploded into the mainstream — reshaping every industry and raising as many questions as it answers.

I'll admit, I felt a little out of the loop at first. But this year, I dove in headfirst — turning ChatGPT (yes, the one I'm writing this post with) into my **second brain**, and experimenting with vibe coding some creative ideas.

At a recent team offsite, we spent time upskilling on AI tools for writing and productivity, which sparked a whole new creative streak in me. It's amazing how much leverage these tools create when used thoughtfully — but also clear that we're in uncharted territory.

Everywhere I look, people are feeling the tension of this moment — the job market, the pressure to perform, the uncertainty about the future. The world feels like it's humming at an anxious frequency, like **Anxiety from *Inside Out 2*** (which I happened to watch one morning during my move). Something has to give.

## 🌅 Holding Onto Hope

Through it all, I remain hopeful.

Our best days aren't behind us — they're ahead. Change has always been the birthplace of reinvention, and I feel it happening in real time.

This move, this year, this chapter — they've all been reminders that growth isn't always graceful. But if you stay open, keep learning, and surround yourself with good people, life has a way of turning chaos into clarity.

So here's to new beginnings, meaningful work, family, and building a life worth coming home to — wherever "home" happens to be.

Thanks for following along on this wild ride. Let's keep making a dent in the universe.
