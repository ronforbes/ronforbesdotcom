## Introduction to My visionOS Game Development Journey

Hello, fellow gamers and tech enthusiasts! I'm Ron, and I'm thrilled to share my journey into the fascinating world of game development, specifically for visionOS. My goal? To reimagine the classic Tetris Attack for modern spatial computing platforms. Why Tetris Attack, you ask? This game, with its unique blend of strategy and speed, captivated me in my younger years, and I believe it's time for a revival - with a twist.

## Why visionOS?

The choice of VisionOS as my development platform was driven by its cutting-edge capabilities in spatial computing. This technology, which allows for more immersive and interactive gaming experiences, is the perfect canvas for redefining a classic game. I am excited to explore the full potential of VisionOS and share my discoveries with you all.

Also, as a product manager on the Quest team at Meta, I spend a lot of my day thinking about our development platform for building spatial experiences. I think there's a lot we can learn from Apple's approach to spatial computing. I also think product managers who have empathy for the developer experience are a powerful asset to their teams. So let's put this CS degree to use and make a visionOS app!

## Learning Curve and Resources

As with any new endeavor, there's a learning curve. I've been delving into the world of visionOS, grappling with its unique features and capabilities. The journey hasn't been smooth sailing, but it's been incredibly rewarding. I'll be sharing tips, resources, and learnings that have helped me along the way - stay tuned for those in my upcoming posts.

## Game Development Diaries

I'm currently in the early stages of developing the game. The concept is to build upon the foundation of Tetris Attack but elevate the experience with spatial computing. Imagine playing in a 3D space, where blocks come to life, and the gameplay becomes more dynamic and interactive. I'll be documenting my progress, challenges, and victories here, with sneak peeks, concept art, and prototype demos.

## Evolving into Online Gaming

The ultimate vision for this project is to evolve it into an online game with various modes. A key feature I'm excited about is the competitive battle system, where players can challenge each other, striving for survival while sending obstacles - or as I like to call them, 'trash blocks' - to their opponents. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions on this!

## Join the Journey

This blog is not just about documenting my journey; it's about building a community. Your feedback, ideas, and enthusiasm will be the driving force behind this project. So, join me on this adventure, let's revive a classic together, and push the boundaries of what's possible in gaming!
