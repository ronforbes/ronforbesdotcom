When I was in grade school, [ronforbes.com](http://ronforbes.com/) was for sale, probably for around $80 per year, which I thought was outrageous at the time.

Around college, it came to be owned by Ron Forbes Construction, a company in Alberta, Canada. I was okay with that at the time and figured, finders keepers, ya snooze ya lose. But it always felt like the one that got away.

Then a few years ago, I heard it briefly went up for sale. Excitedly, I searched for it on Namecheap and discovered that I'd missed my chance to buy it again. Since then, it was being squatted and sold on the aftermarket for several hundred dollars.

Today, I bit the bullet and bought the domain. Was it really necessary? No, probably not. But I'm just the kind of person that wants to own [ronforbes.com](http://ronforbes.com/). We did it, high school me.
