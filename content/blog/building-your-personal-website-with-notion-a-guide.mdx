In an age where personal branding and content distribution are essential for creators, entrepreneurs, and professionals, having a streamlined, accessible personal website is a game-changer. I've experimented with various tools over the years, but ultimately, I landed on Notion as the backbone of my digital presence. In this post, I'll share why I chose Notion, how I've structured my site, and tips for making the most of it.

## Why Notion?

When I set out to build a personal website, I had a few key priorities:

- **Ease of Use:** I wanted a tool that didn't require coding or complex site management.
- **Content-Centric:** The platform needed to prioritize written content, archiving, and easy organization.
- **Cross-Platform Syncing:** I needed a solution that worked seamlessly across desktop, mobile, and web.
- **Dynamic Updating:** I wanted the ability to update content instantly, without fussing over design.

Notion checked all these boxes. Its document-style interface allows me to focus on writing, while its database functionality makes it easy to organize and surface content dynamically. Unlike traditional CMS platforms, Notion doesn't get in the way of content creation—it enhances it.

## How I Built My Notion Website

I use **Super.so** to turn my Notion pages into a fully functional website. This enhances Notion's capabilities with custom domain hosting, SEO features, and additional design flexibility. Here's how I structured my site:

### 1. A Centralized Content Hub

Notion acts as the foundation for my **second brain**—a system where I store years of product management knowledge, writing, and ideas. My site houses:

- Blog posts
- Archived newsletters
- Links to YouTube videos
- Collections of tweetstorms from Threads

### 2. Dynamic Surfacing with Databases

Rather than using a static webpage structure, I leverage Notion's database functionality to filter and display content based on topics, tags, and formats. This allows visitors to navigate my site fluidly, discovering relevant content with ease.

### 3. Embedded Content for a Seamless Experience

To make my site feel like a cohesive platform rather than just a Notion workspace, I embed:

- **Substack newsletter sign-ups** (so visitors can subscribe without leaving the page)
- **YouTube videos** directly into blog posts for added engagement

### 4. Reusable Components with Synced Blocks

Notion's **synced blocks** are one of my favorite features. I use them to create reusable elements across my site, such as:

- **Call-to-action blocks** for newsletter sign-ups
- **A persistent footer** with links to my social channels
- **Navigational elements** that maintain consistency across pages

## Tips & Tricks for Optimizing Your Notion Website

If you're considering building your personal site with Notion, here are some tips to make the process smoother:

### 1. Prioritize Content Over Design

It's easy to get caught up tweaking design elements, but at the end of the day, compelling content drives engagement. Notion's simplicity forces you to focus on what matters: writing and sharing valuable insights.

### 2. Use Databases to Stay Organized

Instead of manually updating pages, structure your content using databases. This lets you:

- Tag posts for easy filtering
- Automatically generate collections of related content
- Keep an archive of past newsletters without cluttering your main blog

### 3. Leverage Super.so for Customization & SEO

While Notion is fantastic, it's not optimized for SEO or design flexibility out of the box. That's where Super.so comes in, allowing you to:

- Customize your site's appearance beyond Notion's default styling
- Improve search visibility with SEO meta tags
- Use a custom domain to establish your brand

### 4. Embed External Tools for Enhanced Functionality

If Notion lacks a feature you need, chances are there's an embed workaround. Some of my favorite integrations include:

- **Substack** for newsletters
- **YouTube** for video content
- **Google Analytics** for tracking visitor engagement

### 5. Keep Manual Work in Check

One challenge with using Notion as a website is that it requires some manual upkeep. Unlike WordPress or other CMS platforms, there's no automation for certain tasks. That said, with the right structure (databases, page templates, synced blocks, and embeds), you can minimize repetitive work.

## Final Thoughts

Notion isn't the perfect solution for everyone, but for me, it provides the ideal balance between **flexibility, simplicity, and functionality**. It allows me to create, organize, and distribute content seamlessly, all while maintaining control over my workflow. With tools like Super.so and strategic use of Notion's features, I've built a personal website that acts as a true content hub.
