Hello, friends and new followers! According to Google Analytics, this website is starting to attract a lot of people from Poland, so "Witamy!"

It's been a while since my last update, and what a journey it has been! I'm thrilled to share with you all the progress we've made on our modern successor to Tetris Attack for VisionOS. From core gameplay mechanics to multiplayer experiences, let's dive into the developments and what's next for us.

## Core Gameplay: Complete

First off, I'm excited to announce that all core gameplay elements are now implemented and functioning! This includes:

- **Block Matching**: The satisfying click of perfectly aligned blocks disappearing from the board.
- **Gravity Mechanics**: Watching blocks fall naturally to fill the gaps, adding depth and strategy to every move.
- **Chain and Combo Detection**: The heart-pounding excitement of chaining moves together for massive points and effects.

These elements are the backbone of our game, providing a solid and engaging experience for players.

## Local Multiplayer: Bringing Competitors Together

The fun doubled when we introduced local multiplayer gameplay. Players can now face off on the same machine, sending garbage blocks to their opponent with successful chains and combos, and converting garbage blocks back to regular ones. This addition has transformed the game into a social, competitive experience.

## Online Multiplayer: A Whole New World

Perhaps the most significant achievement has been implementing online multiplayer. This was indeed a Herculean task, introducing layers of complexity to our development. However, the result is nothing short of magical: players from different locations can now connect and compete in real-time, bringing our game into the global arena.

**Polish and Feel: The Devil's in the Details**

With the core mechanics and multiplayer functionality in place, our focus has shifted to polishing the game and enhancing the "feel." This stage is crucial for making the game not just playable but thoroughly enjoyable. It's about refining visuals, animations, sounds, and feedback to create a captivating and immersive experience.

## Looking Forward: Marketing and Community Building

As we add polish to the game, I plan to ramp up our marketing efforts. Social media engagement is key, but we've learned that prototypes get a lukewarm reception without a certain level of finish. So, as we refine the game's feel, we'll start sharing our progress more actively to build an audience and gather valuable feedback.

## What's Next?

We're still in the early stages of this adventure, but the progress has been incredibly rewarding. As we continue to polish the prototype, we'll also begin to explore additional features needed for a full-fledged game. Establishing an engaged community and iterating based on feedback will be our guiding principles moving forward.

## Join Us on This Exciting Journey

This journey has been a blend of challenges and triumphs, and sharing it with you makes it all the more meaningful. Your support, feedback, and enthusiasm fuel our progress, and I can't wait to bring you along as we move to the next stages of development.

Onward to the next milestone!
