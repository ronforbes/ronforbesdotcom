The recently released Seamless Multitasking feature for Meta Quest is a game-changer for productivity and entertainment in mixed reality. It allows you to run 2D windows alongside immersive apps, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency.

Whereas previously, you needed to close 2D windows to continue using immersive apps, now you can keep your windows open and "pinned on top". So whether you want to watch a tutorial video while exploring an environment or browse the web without leaving your favorite game, Seamless Multitasking makes it possible.

In this blog post, I'll guide you through enabling the feature, how to use it effectively, and explore different scenarios where it can elevate your experience. By the way, this should work on all Quest devices, including Quest 2, Quest Pro, Quest 3, and the new Quest 3S.

## Enabling Seamless Multitasking

The Seamless Multitasking feature is still experimental, so you'll need to activate it manually. Here's how:

1. **Update Your Quest Software:**
Ensure your headset is updated to the latest software version (v69 or higher). You can check for updates in Settings.
2. **Navigate to Experimental Features:**
Open Settings, and select "Experimental Features".
3. **Enable Seamless Multitasking:**
Look for the Seamless Multitasking toggle and switch it on. Your headset may prompt you to restart for the changes to take effect.

Once activated, you're ready to go. Let's get multitasking!

## Using Seamless Multitasking

After enabling the feature, Seamless Multitasking integrates intuitively into workflow between immersive and windowed apps. Here's how to use it:

1. **Launch an immersive app:**
Start any immersive application from the App Library, such as a game or social world.
2. **Open a 2D app:**
Bring up the Universal Menu. From here, you can launch 2D apps like the Browser, YouTube, or Remote Desktop.
3. **Arrange Your Windows:**
Use your controller or hands to position and resize the 2D windows within your space. I like to place them slightly to the side so I can easily glance at them.
4. **Switch Between Tasks:**
Seamlessly switch your focus between the immersive app and 2D windows by clicking between them.

### Productivity Boost

- Use a note-taking app to jot down ideas while brainstorming in an immersive whiteboard app.

- Chat with friends in a messaging app without leaving your hangout space.

### Gaming Strategy

- Follow a walkthrough or strategy guide while playing a challenging immersive game.
- Stream your gameplay on one window while monitoring audience reactions in another.
